Wheater
======

This is a very simple weather application designed to be easy to read (especially on a smartphone),
and friendly for photographers.

- It uses the [Forecast.io]() API.

- It automatically choose the current location (if available), otherwise asks for something from you.

- It selects the next two interesting events (sunrise/sunset) from the current time and display their weather.
